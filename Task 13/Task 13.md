# Difference Between Physical Pixels and Digital Pixels

## Pixel
**Pixel**: Abbreviation for "picture element." Represents the smallest unit of a digital image.

### 1️⃣ Physical Pixels
- Tiny colored lights on a screen that shine at your eyes to display images.  
- An actual light (technically three lights) behind the glass on your device.

### 2️⃣ Logical Pixels
- Specify color values on a grid of tiny squares representing the image.  
- Commonly used when describing images by their pixel dimensions in Photoshop.

## Other Types of Colors in CSS

### HWB (Hue, Whiteness, Blackness)
- **Hue**: Ranges from 0 to 360.  
- **Whiteness and Blackness**: Each ranges from 0 to 100%.

### CMYK Colors
- Combines **Cyan**, **Magenta**, **Yellow**, and **Black**.

### NCol by W3Schools
- Uses a color letter (RYGCBM) with a percentage to specify distance from the base color (e.g., `R30` is 30% towards Yellow).  
- Includes **Whiteness** and **Brightness**, each ranging from 0 to 100%.  
- Example: `data-w3-color="R50,50%,0"`

> **Note**: HWB, CMYK, and NCol aren't supported in HTML yet but can be used with W3Schools' Color library via `data-w3-color`.
