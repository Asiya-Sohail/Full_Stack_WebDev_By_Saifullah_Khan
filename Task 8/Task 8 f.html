    <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between front-end and back-end development?</summary>
        <p>Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website that users interact with, using technologies 
            like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development involves server-side operations, databases, and application logic, 
            typically using languages like Python, PHP, or Node.js.</p>

        <summary>What is responsive design, and why is it important?</summary>
        <p>Responsive design ensures a website looks and functions well across different screen sizes and devices. It's crucial for 
            improving user experience, accessibility, and SEO rankings since more users access websites on mobile devices.</p>

        <summary>What is the purpose of a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS?</summary>
        <p>CSS preprocessors extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making the code more manageable and reusable. 
            They streamline the development process and help maintain consistency across larger projects.</p>

        <summary>What is the difference between a static website and a dynamic website?</summary>
        <p>Static websites are built with fixed content that doesnâ€™t change unless manually updated, often using only HTML and CSS. 
            Dynamic websites generate content in real time, often powered by databases and server-side scripts like PHP or Node.js.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>What are APIs, and how are they used in web development?</summary>
        <p>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate. In web development, APIs are 
            used to fetch or send data between servers and applications, enabling features like user authentication, real-time updates, 
            or integration with third-party services.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>What is the role of version control systems like Git in web development?</summary>
        <p>Version control systems like Git track changes to code over time, enabling collaboration among developers. They allow for easy 
            branching, merging, and rollback of code, making it easier to manage projects and maintain code integrity.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>How does SEO impact web development?</summary>
        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) ensures a website ranks higher in search results. Web development impacts SEO through clean 
            code, fast loading times, mobile optimization, and implementing metadata and structured data.</p>

    <details>
        <summary>What is the purpose of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue?</summary>
        <p>These JavaScript frameworks simplify building complex user interfaces by providing reusable components, state management, 
            and virtual DOM. They speed up development and improve the efficiency of single-page applications (SPAs).</p>

    <details>
        <summary>What is cross-browser compatibility, and how do developers ensure it?</summary>
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility means a website works correctly across all major browsers. Developers ensure this by using modern 
            standards, testing on multiple browsers, and using polyfills or libraries like Modernizr to handle inconsistencies.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>How do Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) improve website performance?</summary>
        <p>CDNs distribute website content across multiple servers worldwide. When a user accesses a site, the content is delivered from 
            the nearest server, reducing latency and improving load times, especially for global audiences.</p>
