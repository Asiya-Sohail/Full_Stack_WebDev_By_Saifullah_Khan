# How Lazy Loading Works

Lazy loading defers loading non-critical resources (e.g., images or iframes) until needed, such as during scrolling or navigation. This reduces page load time and optimizes network usage.

### Syntax:
```html
<img loading="lazy" src="image.jpg" alt="..." />
```

This delays iframe loading until the user scrolls near it, enabling fastplay without initial delays.

### Syntax:
```html
<iframe loading="lazy" src="video-player.html" title="..."></iframe>
```
